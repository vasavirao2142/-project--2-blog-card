Here i learn about the ue of aria-labels.
I came to learn why it is important because it makes screen readers to use the website.
we should use semantic html whenever possible.
Use TabIndex for tab focus and learned how to include font from ttf file using 
@font-face{
    font-family:"";
    url:""  // path to that font ttf file
}

Learned about clamp function for providing responsive number
e.x:

font-size:clamp(min,normal,max) value
